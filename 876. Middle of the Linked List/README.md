# 876. Middle of the Linked List
### my idea was to traverse through the linked list, find its size and then traverse again to the middle
### O(n) --> time complexity
### O(1) --> space complexity
### another idea is to make an array with the values in LL , find the middle return it
### O(n) --> time complexity
### O(n) --> space complexity

### one of the solutions that blow my mind
### make two pointer slow , fast pointer
### pointer fast = 2 slow 
### that means when fast pointer at the end the slow pointer at the middle
### O(n) --> time complexity
### O(1) --> space complexity
