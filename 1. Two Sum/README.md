# 1. Two Sum

### brute force solution  
### loop for each element and check if it can sum to the target.
### this is obviously computationally time complexity O(n<sup> 2 </sup>) 

### efficient method is to loop for each element in the array if its reminder is in the dictionary 
### return them in an array
### else add this element & its index into the dictionary
### and this is O(n)
