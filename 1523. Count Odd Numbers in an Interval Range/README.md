counting the ood numbers between two integers
        we count the NO. of odd below
        we count the NO. of high below
        then subtract them from each other
     we have 4 cases
      1. low is odd and high is odd
        then the output is high // 2 - low // 2 + 1 ( because the low will be removed because of subtraction
      2. low is even and high is odd
        then the output is high // 2 - low // 2
     3. low is odd and high is even
        then the output is high // 2 - low // 2 + 1 ( because the low will be removed because of subtraction
     4. low is even and high is even
        then the output is high // 2 - low // 2
